## Version 1.2
# Comments, most of the logic works, still need to implement player 2, battle simulation/logic and scoreboard. 
# OOP Principles used: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, static methods

# ----- Idea ------
# Thought process (for me):
# Create a class for character creation
# main function calls class methods
# store selected attributes
# give option to create own class and attributes (work on)
# Create logic for character battle (work on)
# Score board? Multiplayer? (work on)

# Logic flow: Create/Select Charcter -> set attributes -> battle against computer or another player -> keep scoreboard

# Game logic.
# Magic/phsyical resistance, attack type, elemental type, dungeon roguelite archtype game. Loot.
